// Data types
// Primitive data types
//   number: represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
//   string: represents a sequence of characters, such as words or phrases.
//   boolean: represents a true or false value.
//   null: represents the absence of a value or a null object reference.
//   undefined: represents the absence of a value or a variable that has not been assigned a value.
//   symbol: represents a unique and immutable value.
// Non-primitive data types -  non-primitive data types are stored as references and are passed by reference
//   object: Objects can be used to store and manipulate complex data structures, such as arrays and other objects.
//   array: Arrays are objects and have a length property and a set of methods for manipulating their elements.
//   function: Functions are objects and have properties and methods, such as the name property and the apply() method.
